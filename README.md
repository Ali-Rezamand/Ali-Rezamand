- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ali-Rezamand
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in I'm interested in the fascinating world of electric vehicles,
 particularly focusing on:
    BLDC Motor Control: I'm passionate about coding and driving Brushless DC Motors (BLDC). Whether it's implementing control algorithms or delving into the intricacies of motor drivers, I'm always eager to learn more.
    PID Tuning: The concept of optimizing performance through PID control loops intrigues me. I'm keen on exploring how to effectively tune these loops to achieve peak efficiency and control in BLDC motors.
    Hybrid Powertrains & Coupling Systems: The synergy between electric motors and combustion engines in hybrid cars is an area that captures my interest. I'm curious about the various coupling systems used and how they manage power delivery for optimal performance.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning different methods of driving all sorts of electric motors.
